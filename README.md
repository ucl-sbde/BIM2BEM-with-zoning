# BIM2BEM_with_zoning

This repository contains representative zoning-based and baseline EnergyPlus models, together with a full-model knowledge graph, supporting the manuscript titled “Automated and Scalable BIM2BEM Framework with Zoning-based Model Simplification Leveraging Knowledge Graph Integration” submitted to Automation in Construction.

# DATA

| File Pattern | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| GeoModel_XXXXXXXXXX.idf | Geometric model generated by different zoning scenarios |
| GeoModel_baseline.idf | Geometric model for full-model baseline without zoning |

Each XXXXXXXXXX is a 10-bit code indicating enabled zoning scenarios.  


| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Knowledge graph for OPS.ttl | RDF triples representing building components and relationships |

# SCRIPT
Scripts and automation tools are included in this repository, but are currently set to private during beta testing. They will be made public after validation, or can be accessed upon request to the corresponding author for testing purposes.
